# midisynth
MIDI notes synthesizer (attempt to algorithmic music through recurrent RBM neural networks).

Modified implementation is based on paper 

Modeling Temporal Dependencies in High-Dimensional Sequences: Application To Polyphonic Music Generation and Transcription

See paper in docs folder. In practice I run out of computer power (no GPUs) so I results were not very good.
